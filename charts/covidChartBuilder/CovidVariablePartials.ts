// Normally all variables come from the WP backend. In this attempt I try and generate variables client side.
// This map contains the meta data for these generated variables which they then can extend. There's the obvious
// issue that this file can get out of data with the WP backend. In addition, this approach is fine for simple
// transformations, but for generating slightly more complex variables like rolling windows with certain parameters,
// which are easy with Pandas, become not as simple if we have to roll our own data transformation library.
// We may want to revert to a Chart Builder that cannot generate variables on the fly.
